Lab 1
Environment Setup Report
I initialised a repository locally and pushed it to a private GitHub repository. I included a readme file stating the objective of Lab 1. After that, I opened the codespace to begin the work.
I already know Python, but not SPADE or XMPP. I searched both to understand how to use them for the outlined lab objective. My findings show that XMPP is an open-source instant messaging platform created by the Jabber Foundation in 1999. It was a good alternative to closed IM systems. The platform enables communication through message channels and logic built around its XML-based protocol. It can be installed and used via a server.
SPADE was developed in 2000 to support research in intelligent agents. SPADE 3 in 2020 introduced new features and applications for designing and simulating agent systems and environments. SPADE is a framework built on top of XMPP.
To start, we verify Python3, SPADE, and an XMPP server. We use Docker to isolate and run the XMPP server for the SPADE agent we plan to build.
To program with XMPP, I checked the documentation and did some AI-powered searching to learn the key concepts. Jabber Identification (JID) is the unique address for each client or resource. Stanzas are the basic packet types you send and receive. A message refers to communication between users. Presence refers to a status, such as being offline or online. IQ refers to information queries which are used to request and modify data from the server to the client.
I verified SPADE installation with pip show spade, pip install spade, and by importing spade to print its version. I registered and used a remote XMPP server from XMPP.JP which is a free messaging service.
In summary, I initialised the repository locally, pushed it to GitHub, and used the codespace to set up the SPADE agent with the remote XMPP credentials as the environment.
