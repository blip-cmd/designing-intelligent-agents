In Artificial Intelligence, a percept refers specifically to the content an agent's sensors are perceiving at any given instant. It is the raw or processed sensory input that provides the agent with information about its environment, such as a camera capturing a single image frame or a thermostat sensing a specific temperature.

While a percept represents a single moment in time, an agent's behavior is often determined by its percept sequence, which is the complete history of everything the agent has ever perceived. The agent function uses this sequence to map inputs to appropriate actions, allowing the agent to react to real-time changes while also accounting for past events to make more rational decisions.

The perception process transforms raw data into meaningful structured information that can be used for reasoning. For example, in an autonomous vehicle, a single percept might be a combination of LiDAR distance readings and camera pixels, which the agent's control system interprets as a "pedestrian" to decide whether to brake or swerve. Thus, percepts serve as the essential gateway for an intelligent agent to understand and interact with the world.
